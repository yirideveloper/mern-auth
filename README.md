# mern-advanced-authentification

I'm not a professional, I can't guarantee that this boilerplate is secure enough for real project usage.

## Boilerplate 

MERN Stack with advanced authentification :

Email verification (Token Based) with resend/reset option, Login with forgot password feature.

Server side sessions.

Mongodb, 

Express,

React/Redux based on Create React App,

Nodejs,

Passport-js local,

Sendgrid API for emails,

Google Captcha,

Notification system.


## Backend and Frontend need 2 separate deployment. 

## Setup BackEnd first
